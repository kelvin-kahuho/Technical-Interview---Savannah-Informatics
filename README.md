# Technical-Interview---Savannah-Informatics
This is a guide on how I accomplished the Technical assignment for the Technical Support Engineer.

The Customer Order App is a simple web application designed for managing customer orders. It has been containerized using Docker, deployed on a microk8s scalable cluster.

## Key Features
- User Authentication and Authorization: Integrated with Keycloak for secure user management.
- Data Validation: Sanitize user inputs using bleach.clean() to prevent XSS
- SMS Notifications: Sends SMS notifications to users when an order is added, using Africa's Talking API.
- Database: Uses MySQL for data storage.
- Scalability: Deployed on a microk8s Kubernetes cluster for scalability and reliability.
- Continuous Deployment: Automated updates using Ansible.

## Prerequisites
- Python
- Docker
- Docker Hub account
- microk8s installed on my server
- Ansible installed on my local machine
- MySQL database
- Keycloak server for user authentication and authorization
- Africa's Talking API credentials for SMS notifications
