# Technical-Interview---Savannah-Informatics
This is a guide on how I accomplished the Technical assignment for the Technical Support Engineer.

The Customer Order App is a simple web application designed for managing customer orders. It has been containerized using Docker, deployed on a microk8s scalable cluster.

## Key Features
- User Authentication and Authorization: Integrated with Keycloak for secure user management.
- Data Validation: Sanitize user inputs using bleach.clean() to prevent XSS
- SMS Notifications: Sends SMS notifications to users when an order is added, using Africa's Talking API.
- Database: Uses MySQL for data storage.
- Scalability: Deployed on a microk8s Kubernetes cluster for scalability and reliability.
- Continuous Deployment: Automated updates using Ansible.

## Prerequisites
- Python
- Docker
- Docker Hub account
- microk8s installed on my server
- Ansible installed on my local machine
- MySQL database
- Keycloak server for user authentication and authorization
- Africa's Talking API credentials for SMS notifications

1. ### Development

I used Flask to create a web service and define routes for the application.

2. ### Testing
Tested my application's routes.

3. ### Dockerize and push the App
Built and pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub.

```sh
docker build -t kestack/customer-order-app:latest .
docker push kestack/customer-order-app:latest
```

4. ### Pull Docker Image on Server
SSH into my server and pulled the Docker image from Docker Hub.

```sh
docker pull kestack/customerorder-app:latest
```

### Summary for microk8s Setup

5. ### Set Up microk8s**

I installed and configured microk8s on my server to deploy the Customer Order App. The setup involved using three key configuration files:

 **deployment.yaml**: 
   - Defined the Kubernetes Deployment for the application, specifying the Docker image, replicas, and other deployment settings.

 **service.yaml**: 
   - Configured the Kubernetes Service to expose the application, facilitating network access to the app. A LoadBalancer service type was used to allow external access.

 **hpa.yaml**: 
   - Set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization, ensuring the application can handle varying loads efficiently.

These files collectively ensured a robust and scalable deployment of the application within the Kubernetes cluster managed by microk8s.

You can find the configuration file in the root directory of this project.

/deployment.yaml 
/service.yaml
/hpa.yaml

6. ### Deployed the app on microk8s

Applied the deployment:

```sh
sudo docker kubectl get all -A
```

7. ### Set Up Keycloak
Used KeyCloak's documentation to get started. https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker

9. Configure SMS Notifications
Set up Africa's Talking API credentials and configured my application to use these credentials for sending SMS notifications.

10. CI/CD Pipeline with Ansible
I Set up ssh keys on my machine and the server for easier and secure communications.

I tested if I can reach my server after defining my hosts "linux" group,
```sh
ansible linux -m ping
```
